# RCD
Download Dataset from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/code/vortexkol/road-damage-and-pothole-detection/data?select=potholes
In ipynb file add path to dataset in code.
Create 'outputs' directory to save model and plots.
Create testing directory to add new photos to test the model and predict the cracks on road in given photos.

Note: set input_dir,output_dir and train_dir paths correctly so that code can be executed smoothly.

Tip: Add message function and call at every step to debug or get error position easily.
